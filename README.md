# KIRAKIRA-Batch
该存储库用于存储批处理脚本，通常情况下，这些脚本会被 Kubernetes Cronjob 定期调度

> A *CronJob* creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.  
> CronJob is meant for performing regular scheduled actions such as backups, report generation, and so on. One CronJob object is like one line of a crontab (cron table) file on a Unix system. It runs a Job periodically on a given schedule, written in Cron format.
